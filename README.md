# Loan Prediction System

## Overview

The Loan Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to automate the loan approval process for banks and financial institutions. By leveraging past data and classification models, the system predicts the likelihood of loan repayment, thereby aiding in faster, fairer, and more accurate decision-making.
